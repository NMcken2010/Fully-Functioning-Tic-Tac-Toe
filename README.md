# Fully-Functioning-Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple yet fully functioning game of tic tac toe to demonstrate understanding of javascript.
Simple display of html, css and javascript. The objective was to create a responsive game using these fundamental building blocks of the web.
I will revisit this project in the future to update the game with the new skill set. Like adding a counter and making it a two player game across two browsers.
Tips and constructive criticism are always welcome, this is a never-ending learning journey!
